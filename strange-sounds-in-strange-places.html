        <p>
          I led groups into the woods to create confounding and mysterious sound installations. 
          This project was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.andfestival.org.uk/">Abandon 
            Normal Devices Festival</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each team had a backpack of cable, sound recording equipment and a small amplifier. 
          They scouted their sounds and locations and got to work. 
        <p>
          Strange Sounds in Strange Place #1: Sounds of a busy Manchester, UK motorway placed in a drainpipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strange Sounds in Strange Place #2: Sounds of a bubbling steam placed overhead to evoke rivers of electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strange Sounds in Strange Place #3: Sounds of a clanging rusty metal springs placed up in a tree.

            of items is meant to recreate the KDZU system that broadcast from the pyramid from
            around 1987 to 1991. In this installation, KDZU broadcast on 88.5 in San Bernardino, 
            California. Museum visitors could DJ the radio station while visiting the exhibit.

            This "grid of chalkboards" system was used by the organization to ideate and make 
            decisions collectively. The chalkboards were reclaimed from a Shelby County School 
            System dumpster. This drawing of a gravitational slingshot trajectory seems to be one of the 
            many ideation projects the organzation worked on. The context for this drawing and its
            importance to the group is unknown. A gravitational slingshot maneuver commonly used to 
            adjust the trajectory and speed of a spacecraft.
