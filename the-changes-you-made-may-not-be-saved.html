          THE CHANGES YOU MADE MAY NOT BE SAVED is an interactive installation for imagining and 
          igniting collectivities in maps, augmented reality, 1:24 scale models, 
          pirate radio, chalkboards and show flyers.

            </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          From 1991 to 1994, a small group in Memphis, Tennessee, joined together under the name 
          OMSA (Orange Mound Space Agency) to establish an anarcho-collectivist counterpoint to the 
          United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
        </p>
        <p>
          A single photograph seems to be the only physical evidence of OMSA's (One More Sexy 
          Anarchist) mission control center located on the top levels of The Pyramid, a neglected 
          sports and entertainment arena on the bank of the Mississippi River. The photo depicts 
          a collage pasted onto the cover of a composition notebook with the sentence"I think the 
          changes worked!" handwritten in black marker. A small hand-drawn map illustrates the 
          back of the photograph, perhaps describing the notebook's hiding place inside The 
          Pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Memphis Police Department raided the group in 1994, demolishing their living 
          quarters, cultural center, and communications infrastructure inside the Pyramid. After 
          the raid, members scattered across the U.S. Mid-South and Midwest. There is no evidence 
          of OMSA's (Our Memphian Stubbornness and Assiduity) scientific endeavors or 
          accomplishments. The notebook captured in the photograph has not been found.
        </p> 
        <p>
          What information can be salvaged about OMSA (Okay. Meanwhile, Stop Asking.) from Rob 
          Ray's interactive installation imagining the long-ago-dissolved group's creative and 
          scientific endeavors inside the Memphis Pyramid? How might OMSA's (Our Maybe Secret 
          Advantage) vision for space exploration shine through in Ray's scale model of the 
          collective's Pyramid facility? Ray extracts what is known and postulates full-scale 
          displays of their communications systems using augmented reality overlays, speculative 
          promotional materials, and pirate radio listening stations. Ray's world-building and 
          interviews with activists, artists, and engineers create pyramidal histories whose 
          pixels and atoms converge, heat, crystalize, collapse, explode and scatter.

            around 1987 to 1991. In this installation, KDZU broadcast on 88.5 in San Bernardino, 
            California. Museum visitors could DJ the radio station while visiting the exhibit.

            This "grid of chalkboards" system was used by the organization to ideate and make 
            decisions collectively. The chalkboards were reclaimed from a Shelby County School 
            System dumpster. This drawing of a gravitational slingshot trajectory seems to be one of the 
            many ideation projects the organzation worked on. The context for this drawing and its
            importance to the group is unknown. A gravitational slingshot maneuver commonly used to 
            adjust the trajectory and speed of a spacecraft.
