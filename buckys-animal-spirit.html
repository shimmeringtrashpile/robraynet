        <p>
          I installed an arcade game disguised as an ATM in a downtown/public areas. People insert 
          their card expecting to withdraw money. Instead they play a game helping Bucky and Toothy 
          Beaver get to the public library and back in touch with their animal spirits!

        <p>Yes, a few folks were puzzled and cautiously slid over to the real ATM next door, but 
          most people stuck around and helped Bucky and Toothy dodge subscription fees and stay 
          wild!
        </p>

        <p>Appropriately, the Bucky's Animal Spirit was stolen... a fate befitting all ATMs. 
        </p>

        <p>If you'd like to see how I constructed the ATM cabinet, you can out the

          <p>Picking the right location really helps. Many legit ATMs look janky, so I only

          <p>People don't like standing in line. They will pick "that weird looking ATM" if it

            still easily go to the other machine, get their cash and be on their way.

          <p>Arcade games disguised as ATMs attract crowds. Word spread and people started coming 
            over just to play it. Suprisingly, I never saw anyone get upset. The building 
            management was notified but they loved it and gave me permission to keep it there as 
            long as I wanted. They encouraged me to lock it up so it wouldn't get stolen.
