        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>I’m Rob. This website address is: https://robray.net.</p>
        
        <h3>The personal data I collect and why I collect it</h3>
        <h4>Media</h4>
        <p>
          I embed media players from other sites, such as youtube.com, vimeo.com,
          spotify.com and others. I can’t control the tracking they do. If I hear
          about some particularly gross stuff they are doing to compromise your
          privacy, I will do my best to block it or try to get media from other
          sources. See the <em>Embedded content from other websites</em> section of this document for more
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          I try to avoid uploading photos of people with embedded location data
          (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors (most likely bots) to the website can
          download these images and extract this location data from photos on the
          website. This data could be used to compromise a person’s privacy. Not
          good.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          I don't intentionally set cookies. If I have set one by mistake I will remedy it.
        </p>
        <h4>Embedded content from other websites</h4>
        <p>
          Things I post on this site often include embedded content (e.g. videos,
          sound files, images, pdfs, etc.). Embedded content from other websites
          behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited this other
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          These websites probably collect data about you, use cookies, embed
          additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interactions with that
          embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded
          content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if I embed a youtube.com video you can expect youtube.com
          to be tracking you. I don’t access this data, but I want to be clear
          that my web pages are exposing you to tracking by third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t run any analytics tools.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Who I share your data with</h3>
        <p>I don’t knowingly share, sell, or trade your data.</p>
        
        <h3>How long I retain your data</h3>
        <p>My website traffic logs are deleted weekly.</p>
        
        <h3>Your rights over your data</h3>
        <p>
          You can request that I erase any personal data I hold about you. Just
          email me, and I’ll flush my logs. This does not include any data I am
          obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Where I send your data</h3>
        <p>Nowhere.</p>
        
        <h3>Data breach procedures</h3>
        <p>
          Should my server get hacked, it is possible, but not likely, that my web
          server logs would get extracted.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Third-party data I receive</h3>
        <p>None.</p>
        
        <h3>Automated decision-making and/or profiling I do</h3>
        <p>None.</p>
