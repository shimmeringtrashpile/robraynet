      ProtoSpace, the Lab's flagship collaborative mixed reality (MR) platform
      for scientists and engineers. He also served as the user interfacing lead
      for <a href="https://medeng.jpl.nasa.gov/covid-19/ventilator/">VITAL</a>, two FDA-approved emergency-use low-cost ventilators developed
      as part of NASA's national response to COVID-19. Rob has also served as a

      From 1999 to 2008, Rob was the founding curator of the DEADTECH electronic
      arts center in Chicago, IL. DEADTECH's unique curatorial vision, workshop
      facilities, and exhibition space were custom-created for the specific
      needs of the electronic artist and performer. DEADTECH exhibited artists
      from across the globe, including the Beige Programming Ensemble, the
      Institute for Applied Autonomy, Sabine Gruffat, Norman White, Myfanwy
      Ashmore, The Seemen, Huong Ngo, and Kazuyuki K. Null.
